As part of my coursework, my teammate and I developed a Burger Ordering Webpage using **Visual Studio Code**. While the project was not fully completed, it enhanced my skills in front-end design, coding, and collaborative development. </br>

**Scenario** </br></br>
During the Coronavirus COVID-19, consumers are not allowed to eat in restaurants. Our restaurant BURGER BOY specially designed a website for food and beverages. We have a wide variety of burgers based on the preferences and tastes of most consumers. Consumers can order food on our website, which is very convenient.
